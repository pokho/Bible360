## Reading Plan Organization & Ordering Rationale

### Core Ordering Principles

The 365-day plan follows a **narrative chronology** rather than strict composition dating. Texts are ordered by:

1. **Narrative Chronology**: Texts ordered by the biblical events they describe, not composition date
2. **Thematic Progression**: Wisdom → Prophecy → Apocalyptic → Gnostic revelation
3. **Canonical Bridge**: Starts with Genesis expansions, ends with apocalyptic visions
4. **Jewish → Christian Transition**: Phases 1-4 are Jewish, Phases 5-7 are increasingly Christian
5. **Complexity Gradient**: Moves from accessible wisdom literature to complex Gnostic cosmology
