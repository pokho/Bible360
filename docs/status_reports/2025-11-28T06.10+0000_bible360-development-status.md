# Bible360 Development Status Report
**Date:** 2025-11-28T06:10+0000
**Project:** Bible360 - Chronological Bible Reading Plans with Multi-Provider Comparison

## Executive Summary

The Bible360 application has been successfully configured and enhanced with improved historical context descriptions across all reading plan providers (ESV, Logos, Blue Letter Bible). The application is now fully functional with proper server configuration and enhanced user experience.

## Completed Work

### 1. Application Infrastructure
- **Server Configuration**: Successfully configured StencilJS to serve consistently on port 3334
- **Build Process**: Resolved nested directory structure issues in build output
- **Script Loading**: Fixed permanent script loading by updating source template instead of output files
- **File Structure**: Corrected build directory configuration to prevent www/www/build/ nesting

### 2. Enhanced Historical Context Descriptions

#### ESV Chronological Plan
- **Primeval History**: Added context about creation, fall, and redemption themes that shape Scripture's narrative arc
- **Patriarchal Period**: Enhanced with covenant promises that form Israel's national identity and God's redemptive plan
- **Egyptian Period & Exodus**: Added foundational event context prefiguring Christ's redemption and worship patterns
- **General Sequence**: Enhanced all descriptions with progressive revelation themes showing God's faithfulness and Christ's preparation

#### Logos Academic Plan
- **Primeval History**: Added academic integration with ancient Near Eastern creation narratives and wisdom traditions
- **Patriarchal Period**: Enhanced with archaeological evidence and comparative ancient Near Eastern texts
- **Job Literature**: Added ancient Near Eastern parallels exploring divine sovereignty and human suffering themes
- **Academic Approach**: Enhanced all descriptions with historical-critical methodology and archaeological context

#### Blue Letter Bible DBRP Plan
- **Gospel Narrative**: Enhanced birth of Christ narratives with divine intervention and prophecy fulfillment
- **OT/NT Integration**: Added chronological bridge context connecting creation to Christ's advent
- **Covenant Continuity**: Enhanced Abraham to Christ connections showing redemptive plan continuity
- **Integrated Reading**: Enhanced all descriptions with typological connections and thematic unity

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- **Source URL Updates**: Fixed all broken links with working URLs:
  - ESV: https://www.esv.org/resources/reading-plans/chronological/
  - Logos: https://www.logos.com/grow/nook-chronological-bible-reading-plan/
  - Blue Letter Bible: https://www.blueletterbible.org/dailyreading/
- **Copyright Update**: Updated copyright year from 2024 to 2025
- **Historical Context**: Enhanced Historical Context column with 1-2 additional lines of descriptive content for all providers

## Technical Resolutions

### Issues Fixed
1. **Script Loading**: Resolved script tags getting lost on server restart by updating src/index.html template
2. **Build Directory**: Fixed nested build directory structure (www/www/build/ → www/build/)
3. **Port Configuration**: Established permanent port 3334 configuration
4. **Missing Files**: Resolved 404 errors for bible360.esm.js and related build files
5. **URL Validation**: Verified all source provider URLs are accessible and working

### Configuration Changes
- `stencil.config.ts`: Updated devServer port configuration and build directory settings
- `src/index.html`: Added proper script loading tags in source template
- `src/components/app-root/app-root.tsx`: Enhanced all historical context descriptions

## Current Application Status
